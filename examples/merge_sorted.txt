Write a function called merge_sorted_lists that merges two sorted lists into one sorted list.

Function Name: merge_sorted_lists
Parameters:
- list1: List[int] (sorted in ascending order)
- list2: List[int] (sorted in ascending order)
Return: List[int] (merged sorted list)

Description:
Given two sorted lists, merge them into a single sorted list containing all elements from both lists.
The function should maintain the sorted order and handle duplicate values.

Examples:
- merge_sorted_lists([1, 3, 5], [2, 4, 6]) = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
- merge_sorted_lists([], [1, 2, 3]) = [1, 2, 3]
- merge_sorted_lists([1, 2, 3], []) = [1, 2, 3]
- merge_sorted_lists([1, 2, 2, 3], [2, 3, 4]) = [1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4]

Edge Cases:
- One or both lists are empty
- Lists of different lengths
- Lists with duplicate values
- Single element lists

Constraints:
- Both input lists are sorted in ascending order
- Preserve duplicates in the output
- Output must be sorted in ascending order
