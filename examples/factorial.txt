Write a function called factorial that calculates the factorial of a non-negative integer.

Function Name: factorial
Parameter: n (integer, n >= 0)
Return: integer (n!)

Description:
The factorial of a non-negative integer n is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n.
By definition, 0! = 1.

Examples:
- factorial(0) = 1
- factorial(1) = 1
- factorial(5) = 120
- factorial(10) = 3628800

Edge Cases:
- Handle n = 0 (should return 1)
- Handle n = 1 (should return 1)
- Handle large values efficiently

Constraints:
- n >= 0
- n <= 20 (to avoid overflow issues)
